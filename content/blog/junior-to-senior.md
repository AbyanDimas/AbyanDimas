I often get asked, "What do I need to learn to be a Senior Dev?" The answer usually isn't a new framework.

## 1. Problem Solving vs. Coding

Juniors are given a solution and asked to code it.
Seniors are given a problem and asked to find the solution.

Before writing code, ask: "Do we even need to build this?"

## 2. Communication

Code is easy; people are hard. A Senior developer bridges the gap between technical requirements and business value. They can explain *why* a refactor is needed to a non-technical manager.

## 3. Mentorship

You are not a Senior if you are the only one who can maintain the codebase. Your job is to elevate the team. Code reviews are not for catching bugs; they are for sharing knowledge.

## 4. Ownership

When production breaks at 3 AM, a Junior waits for instruction. A Senior takes responsibility.
